Axes
****


Set Ups
-------

In this documentation, let's assume we predefine ``Axis`` objects as follows.
::

  import ngraph as ng
  import numpy as np

  A = ng.Axis(length=1)
  B = ng.Axis(length=2)
  C = ng.Axis(length=3)
  D = ng.Axis(length=4)

  A_ = ng.Axis(length=1)
  B_ = ng.Axis(length=2)
  C_ = ng.Axis(length=3)
  D_ = ng.Axis(length=4)

Specifically, we let ``X`` and ``X_`` to be two axes of the same length but under
different labels.


Property of Axes
----------------

1. **A tensor cannot have repetitive axes.**

  For example, ::

      x = ng.Constant(np.ones((2, 2)), axes=ng.Axes([B, B]))  # throws exception
      x = ng.Constant(np.ones((2, 2)), axes=ng.Axes([B, B_]))  # correct


2. **The order of Axes does not matter.** ::

  - Two tensors ``x`` and ``y`` are considered "equivalent" if

    - ``x`` and ``y`` have the same number of axes and same set of axes
    - After shuffling of ``y``'s axes to be the same order of ``x``'s, the underlying value are the same.

  - For example, ``x`` and ``y`` are considered "equivalent" in the following scripts ::

        np_val = np.random.rand(2, 3)
        x = ng.Constant(np_val, axes=ng.Axes([B, C]))
        y = ng.Constant(np_val.T, axes=ng.Axes([C, B]))


Elementwise Binary Ops
----------------------

- When matches, output the same axis. ::

  (A,) + (A,) -> (A,)
  (A, B) + (A, B) -> (A, B)

- Automatic broadcasting / dim shuffle, the output axis order determined by input axis order of the left and right operands. ::

  (A, B) + (A,) -> (A, B)
  (A, B) + (B,) -> (A, B)
  (A, B) + (B, C) -> (A, B, C)
  (A, B) + (C, B) -> (A, B, C)
  (A, B) + (C, B, D) -> (A, B, C, D)

- Commutative property is as usual, though axis order of the equivalent tensors can be different. ::

  (A,) + (B,) -> (A, B)
  (B,) + (A,) -> (B, A)
  (A,) + (B, C) -> (A, B, C)
  (B, C) + (A,) -> (B, C, A)

- Associative property is as usual. ::

  ((A,) + (B,)) + (C,) -> (A, B) + (C,) -> (A, B, C)
  (A,) + ((B,) + (C,)) -> (A,) + (B, C) -> (A, B, C)

- Distributive property is as usual. ::

  (A,) * ((B,) + (C,)) = (A,) * (B, C) = (A, B, C)
  (A,) * (B,) + (A,) * (C,) = (A, B) * (A, C) = (A, B, C)


Dot Products
------------

- Standard 2d dot. ::

  (A, B) • (B, C) -> (A, C)

- Dot operation will take place in overlapping axes of the left and right operands. That is, the overlapping axes will be eliminated in the output tensor. ::

  (A, B, C) • (B, C, D) -> (A, D)
  (A, B) • (A,) -> (B,)

- Left & right operands can be swapped, order of axis can be swapped, results are equivalent, though order can be different. ::

  (A, B) • (B, C) -> (A, C)
  (B, A) • (B, C) -> (A, C)
  (B, C) • (A, B) -> (C, A)


Axes Reduction
--------------

- Reduction operations can have arbitrary number of reduction axis, which, alternatively we specify them as ``out_axis``.
- The ``out_axis`` order can be arbitrary, as long as all axes in ``out_axis`` is in the original tensor's axes.
- When ``out_axis`` is empty list or tuple, reduction is performed on all axes.

Examples: ::

    reduce((A, B, C), out_axis=()) -> ()
    reduce((A, B, C), out_axis=(A,)) -> (A,)
    reduce((A, B, C), out_axis=(A, B)) -> (A, B)
    reduce((A, B, C), out_axis=(C, B)) -> (C, B)



Casting Axis
------------

Use ``AxesCastOp`` to cast at tensor to known axes. The user must user that the
targeting axes has the same length as the origin tensor's axes at all
coordinates.

- Example 1: adding two tensors of shape ``(2, 3)`` but with differently named axis ::

    x = ng.Constant(np.ones((2, 3)), axes=ng.Axes([B, C]))
    y = ng.Constant(np.ones((2, 3)), axes=ng.Axes([B_, C_]))
    # z1 have axes: (B, C, B_, C_)
    z1 = x + y
    # z2 have axes: (B, C), which is what we expect
    z2 = x + ng.AxesCastOp(y, x.axes)

- Example 2: invalid casting::

    y = ng.Constant(np.ones((2, 3)), axes=ng.Axes([B_, C_]))
    z1 = ng.AxesCastOp(y, axes=ng.Axes([B, C]))  # valid
    z2 = ng.AxesCastOp(y, axes=ng.Axes([C, B]))  # exception when evaluated
    z3 = ng.AxesCastOp(y, axes=ng.Axes([B, D]))  # exception when evaluated
