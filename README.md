# Graphitti: Computation Graphs

## Installation
Neon backend factories are needed.  They can be found in private-neon in the scyphers/backend_factory5 branch.

## Examples
ununoctium/examples/models.py is a cifar_mlp example that runs.
ununoctium/examples/dtest.py is cifar_mlp for the new front end.
ununoctium/examples/rnn.py is a simple rnn example using the new front end that matches a sequence of inputs and outputs.
