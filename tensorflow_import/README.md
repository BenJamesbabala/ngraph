# Run TensorFlow Graph with Neon

## Example Usage
1. Preparation.

    ```sh
    $ ./mnist_prepare.sh
    ```

  This will
    - Fetch TensorFlow fetch data and train for 2 epochs. Dump the training
      graph and model checkpoints.
    - Freeze the model checkpoints to protobuf using [this tool]. The
      `--output_node_names` option is the name of the last operation for
      inference, which is currently manually identified on TensorBoard.
2. Inference. Now we can import the TensorFlow-trained weights and perform
   inference using `ngraph`.  Notes that we need to manually identify the last op
   used in inference, which is `softmax_linear/add` for this example.

    ```sh
    $ python mnist_mlp_inference.py
    ```

3. Or, we can use `ngraph` to train and eval from `GraphDef` directly.

    ```sh
    $ python mnist_mlp_train.py
    ```

4. A tool to clean up the mnist data is also provided.

    ```sh
    $ python mnist_clean.py
    ```

## Some Notes on TensorFlow
- TensorFlow is now automatically installed when `ngraph` installs. We may
  remove this dependency in the future.
- Save graph definition to protobuf

    ```python
    tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, "./", "graph.pb.txt", True)  # text proto
    tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, "./", "graph.pb", False)  # binary proto
    ```

- Save trainable parameters to checkpoints.

    ```python
    saver = tf.train.Saver()
    saver.save(sess, "model.ckpt")    # done periodically or at the end of training
    ```

  We made a copy of `3rd_party/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py` and modified it by
  adding code for saving `GraphDef` and trained parameters.
- Visualize using TensorBoard (default on <http://0.0.0.0:6006>).

    ```sh
    $ tensorboard --logdir=.
    ```

- The GraphDef contains several sub-graphs for different purpose:
    - Variable initialization: executed only once before training
    - Fprop and bprop: executed for each mini-batch optimization
    - Serialization & statistics report
- MetaGraph
    - The `save()` API also automatically exports a [MetaGraphDef] (.meta) file,
        which contains MetaInfoDef, GraphDef, SaverDef and CollectionDef.
    - As explained [here], the `MetaGraphDef` includes all information required to
        restore a training or inference process, including the GraphDef that
        describes the dataflow, and additional annotations that
        describe the variables, input pipelines, and other relevant information.
