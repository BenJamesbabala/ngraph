        [TensorFlow Docs]
        Inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.

        **Important**: This tensor will produce an error if evaluated. Its value must
        be fed using the `feed_dict` optional argument to `Session.run()`,
        `Tensor.eval()`, or `Operation.run()`.

        For example:

        ```python
        x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1024, 1024))
        y = tf.matmul(x, x)

        with tf.Session() as sess:
            print(sess.run(y))  # ERROR: will fail because x was not fed.

            rand_array = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)
            print(sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: rand_array}))  # Will succeed.
        ```

        Args:
            dtype: The type of elements in the tensor to be fed.
            shape: The shape of the tensor to be fed (optional). If the shape is not
                   specified, you can feed a tensor of any shape.
            name: A name for the operation (optional).

        Returns:
            A `Tensor` that may be used as a handle for feeding a value, but not
            evaluated directly.
