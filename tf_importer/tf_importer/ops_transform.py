        Given `tensor`, this operation returns a tensor that has the same values

        If one component of `shape` is the special value -1, the size of that dimension

        Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of 1 at the

        zero; if you specify a negative number for `dim` it is counted backward from
