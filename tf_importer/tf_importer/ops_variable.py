        See the [Variables How To](../../how_tos/variables/index.md) for a high
        level overview.

        A variable maintains state in the graph across calls to `run()`. You add a
        variable to the graph by constructing an instance of the class `Variable`.

        The `Variable()` constructor requires an initial value for the variable,
        which can be a `Tensor` of any type and shape. The initial value defines the
        type and shape of the variable. After construction, the type and shape of
        the variable are fixed. The value can be changed using one of the assign
        methods.

        If you want to change the shape of a variable later you have to use an
        `assign` Op with `validate_shape=False`.

        Just like any `Tensor`, variables created with `Variable()` can be used as
        inputs for other Ops in the graph. Additionally, all the operators
        overloaded for the `Tensor` class are carried over to variables, so you can
        also add nodes to the graph by just doing arithmetic on variables.

        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf

        # Create a variable.
        w = tf.Variable(<initial-value>, name=<optional-name>)

        # Use the variable in the graph like any Tensor.
        y = tf.matmul(w, ...another variable or tensor...)

        # The overloaded operators are available too.
        z = tf.sigmoid(w + y)

        # Assign a new value to the variable with `assign()` or a related method.
        w.assign(w + 1.0)
        w.assign_add(1.0)
        ```

        When you launch the graph, variables have to be explicitly initialized before
        you can run Ops that use their value. You can initialize a variable by
        running its *initializer op*, restoring the variable from a save file, or
        simply running an `assign` Op that assigns a value to the variable. In fact,
        the variable *initializer op* is just an `assign` Op that assigns the
        variable's initial value to the variable itself.

        ```python
        # Launch the graph in a session.
        with tf.Session() as sess:
                # Run the variable initializer.
                sess.run(w.initializer)
                # ...you now can run ops that use the value of 'w'...
        ```

        The most common initialization pattern is to use the convenience function
        `initialize_all_variables()` to add an Op to the graph that initializes
        all the variables. You then run that Op after launching the graph.

        ```python
        # Add an Op to initialize all variables.
        init_op = tf.initialize_all_variables()

        # Launch the graph in a session.
        with tf.Session() as sess:
                # Run the Op that initializes all variables.
                sess.run(init_op)
                # ...you can now run any Op that uses variable values...
        ```

        If you need to create a variable with an initial value dependent on another
        variable, use the other variable's `initialized_value()`. This ensures that
        variables are initialized in the right order.

        All variables are automatically collected in the graph where they are
        created. By default, the constructor adds the new variable to the graph
        collection `GraphKeys.VARIABLES`. The convenience function
        `all_variables()` returns the contents of that collection.

        When building a machine learning model it is often convenient to distinguish
        betwen variables holding the trainable model parameters and other variables
        such as a `global step` variable used to count training steps. To make this
        easier, the variable constructor supports a `trainable=<bool>` parameter. If
        `True`, the new variable is also added to the graph collection
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. The convenience function
        `trainable_variables()` returns the contents of this collection. The
        various `Optimizer` classes use this collection as the default list of
        variables to optimize.
