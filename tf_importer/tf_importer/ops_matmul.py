        TODO: support transpose

        [TensorFlow Docs]
        Multiplies matrix `a` by matrix `b`, producing `a` * `b`.

        The inputs must be two-dimensional matrices, with matching inner dimensions,
        possibly after transposition.

        Both matrices must be of the same type. The supported types are:
        `float`, `double`, `int32`, `complex64`.

        Either matrix can be transposed on the fly by setting the corresponding flag
        to `True`. This is `False` by default.

        If one or both of the matrices contain a lot of zeros, a more efficient
        multiplication algorithm can be used by setting the corresponding
        `a_is_sparse` or `b_is_sparse` flag to `True`. These are `False` by default.

        For example:

        ```python
        # 2-D tensor `a`
        a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], shape=[2, 3]) => [[1. 2. 3.]
                                                            [4. 5. 6.]]
        # 2-D tensor `b`
        b = tf.constant([7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], shape=[3, 2]) => [[7. 8.]
                                                               [9. 10.]
                                                               [11. 12.]]
        c = tf.matmul(a, b) => [[58 64]
                              [139 154]]
        ```

        Args:
            a: `Tensor` of type `float`, `double`, `int32` or `complex64`.
            b: `Tensor` with same type as `a`.
            transpose_a: If `True`, `a` is transposed before multiplication.
                         transpose_b: If `True`, `b` is transposed before multiplication.
                         a_is_sparse: If `True`, `a` is treated as a sparse matrix.
                         b_is_sparse: If `True`, `b` is treated as a sparse matrix.
            name: Name for the operation (optional).

        Returns:
            A `Tensor` of the same type as `a`.
