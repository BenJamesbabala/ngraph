Building graphs
***************
An operational graph is a device-independent program for performing computations. One can interact directly with the op-graph API, or use a variety of frontends (such as neon) to convert a model description into an op-graph. In order
to run the computations, use a transformer to compile the graph into a format that can be executed a desired backend (e.g. CPU, GPU, etc.)

To build op-graphs, we link together a sequence of operations that are instances of the class ``Op``. These operations are organized under several base classes:

* ``Op``: Base class for all ops.
* ``TensorOp (Op)``: Ops that produce a Tensor.
* ``ComputationOp (TensorOp)``: TensorOps with added backtrace functionality.
* ``ReductionOp (ComputationOp)``: Ops that reduce over some axes (e.g. sum).
* ``ElementWise (ComputationOp)``: Ops that perform element-wise calculations.
* ``ElementWiseBoolean (ElementWise)``: Boolean element-wise ops.

Supported ops are shown in the below figure:

Graph evaluation
================

During computation, the input and output values must be stored somehwere. To create a ``placeholder`` expression in the operational graph, we must import the operational backend symbols and then create the ``placeholder``::

    import geon as be
    import geon.frontends.base.axis as ax

    x = be.placeholder(axes=be.Axes(ax.C, ax.W, ax.H, ax.N))

This will create an ``AllocationOp`` for a ``placeholder`` with the provided list of axes and assign the op to the python variable ``x``.  When the op is used in a graph, the op serves as a Python handle for the tensor stored in the device.

It is important to remember that ``x`` is a Python variable that holds an op.  Therefore, the following code::

    x = x + x

does not directly double the value of the tensor in the ``placeholder``. Instead, the ``__add__`` method is called with
both arguments pointing to the same ``placeholder`` object. This returns a new ``Op`` that is now stored as the python variable ``x``.
On the other hand, to directly modify the value of the ``placeholder``, use::

    be.SetItem(x, x + x)

Constructing the graph is mostly manipulating expressions, so ``SetItem`` is rarely used, except for updating variables at the end of training a batch. Consider::

    x1 = x + x
    y = x1 * x1 - x

The intermediate value ``x + x`` is only computed once, since the same op is used for both arguments of the multiplication in ``y``.
Furthermore, in this computation, all the computations will automatically be performed in place. If the computation is later modified such that the intermediate value ``x + x`` is needed, the op-graph will automatically adjust the computation's implementation to make the intermediate result ``x + x`` available.  This same flexibility exists with NumPy or PyCUDA, but those implementations always allocate tensors for the intermediate values, relying on Python's garbage collector clean them up; the peak memory usage will be higher and there will be more overhead.

Derivatives
===========

Because the ops describe computations, we have enough information to compute derivatives, using the ``deriv``
function::

    import geon as be
    import geon.frontends.base.axis as ax

    x = be.placeholder(axes=be.Axes((ax.C, ax.W, ax.H, ax.N)))
    y0 = be.placeholder(axes=be.Axes((ax.Y, ax.N))
    w = be.Variable(axes=(be.Axes((ax.C, ax.W, ax.H, ax.Y))))
    b = be.Variable(axes=(be.Axes((ax.Y,)))
    y = be.tanh(dot(w, x) + b)
    c = dot((y - y0), (y - y0))
    d = deriv(c, w)

The op `d` will be the op for the derivative of the value of `dc/dw`.

In this example, we knew which ops contain the variables to be trained (e.g. ``w``).  For a more general
optimizer, we could search through all the subexpressions looking for the dependant variables.  This is handled by the ``variables`` method, so ``c.variables()`` would be the list ``[w, b]``.

Graph execution
===============

A *computation* is a subset of ops whose values are desired and corresponds to a callable procedure on a backend.
Users define one or more computations by specifying sets of ops to be computed.  In addition, the transformer
will define four additional procedures:

`allocate`
    Allocate required storage required for all computations.  This includes all allocations for all ops
    marked as `in`.

`initialize`
    Run all initializations.  These are all the `initializers` for the ops needed for the computations.  These
    are analogous to C++ static initializers.

`save`
    Save all persistent state.  These are states with the `persistent` property set.

`restore`
    Restore saved state.


General properties of ops
=========================

All operational graph ops are instances of the class :py:class:`geon.op_graph.op_graph.Op`, which is a subclass of
the class :py:class:`geon.op_graph.nodes.Node`, which is itself a subclass of the classes
:py:class:`geon.op_graph.names.NameableValue` and :py:class:`geon.op_graph.nodes.DebugInfo`.

The constructor's required arguments are the subexpressions.  All ops also have key initializers for:

`axes`
    The axes of the result of the computation.  This only needs to be specified if the result is not correct.
    The `axes` are available as a gettable property.

`name`
    A string that can help identify the node during debugging, or when search for a node in a set of nodes.
    Some front ends may also make use of the `name`.  The `name` is a settable property.

`tags`
    A set of values that can be used to filter ops when manipulating them.  For example, tags may be used to
    indicate groups of trainable variables in conjunction with drop-out.

`initializers`
    A set of ops that must be executed during the `initialize` operation.

`follows`
    A set of ops, in addition to the `args`, that should be executed before the op using them is run.

Some useful properties of ops are:

`args`
    The subexpressions of the op.  These will be computed before the op is computed, since the operation needs their
    values to compute its value.

`users`
    The set of all nodes that use this node as an argument.

`filename`
    The file that created the op.

`lineno`
    The line number in the file where the op was created.

`file_info`
    The file and line number formatted for debuggers that support clicking on a file location to edit that location.
