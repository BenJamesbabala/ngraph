************

Nervana's graph architecture has three layers, the model description, the operational graph,
and the MOP (Machine-learning OPerations).  Models are described using higher-level APIs such
as neon or TensorFlow\ |trade|.  Front-ends specific to the API use the operational graph API
to convert the model description into an operational graph.  Back-ends correspond to compute
platforms, such as GPUs or CPUs.  A combination of generic and
back-end specific transformers optimize the operational graph and convert it to a form
that can be run on the back-end.  The operational graph API is shared by all front-ends and
back-ends.

The operational graph API can be used directly, both as an alternative to a front-end and as
an extension mechanism for front-ends.
